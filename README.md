# Interview Scheduler

Interview scheduler is a single-page app that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors. 

The front end of this project is built with React and makes requests to an API to fetch and store appointment data from a database. It is also tested with different environments, Webpack Dev Server, Storybook, Jest and Cypress.  

### Users can ...
- make an appointment between the hours of 12 PM and 5 PM, Monday to Friday
- enter any student name while the interviewer is chosen from a predefined list
- can save the appointment and view the entire schedule of appointments on any day of the week
- can also edit or delete appointments
